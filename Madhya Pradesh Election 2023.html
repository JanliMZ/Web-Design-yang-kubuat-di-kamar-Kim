              <h3><p font="Arial" class="large" class="center"width="200%">Madhya Pradesh Election 2023: Congress expels 39 rebel leaders for six years</p></h3>
              <p font="Arial">The voting for the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly will be held in a single phase on November 17, and the counting of votes will take place on December 3.</p> </div>
              <p font="Arial">The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday announced the schedule for the upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, along with four other states. The voting for the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly will be in a single phase on November 17, 2023. Results will be announced on December 3, 2023.</p>
                
              <p>Reacting to the announcement of the poll schedule, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to X (formerly Twitter) and said in Hindi,  "The BJP has been continuously receiving love from the people of Madhya Pradesh. Once again, it has to maintain the pace of development. Madhya Pradesh has faith in the double engine government. The voters of the state are aware and know that Madhya Pradesh can be taken on the path of development only with the help of the lotus, so this time Diwali will be of the lotus."</p>
                
              <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is currently the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh, with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan leading the government. The BJP has been in power in the state for the past 15 years, and it is facing a strong challenge from the opposition Congress.</p>
                
              <p>The Congress party is led by Kamal Nath, who served as the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh from 2018 to 2020. The Congress was ousted from power in Madhya Pradesh in 2020 after some of its MLAs defected to the BJP.</p>
                
              <p>The upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh are crucial for both the BJP and the Congress party. The BJP is looking to retain power in the state, while the Congress is aiming to make a comeback.</p>
                
              <p>The Congress was the main opposition party in Madhya Pradesh for most of the past three decades. However, the party made a comeback in the 2018 assembly elections, winning 114 seats. The BJP won 109 seats in the 2018 elections.</p>
                
              <p>In March 2020, the BJP came back to power in Madhya Pradesh after the Congress government collapsed. Shivraj Singh Chouhan was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the state for the fourth time.</p>
                
              <p>A victory for the BJP in the upcoming polls would further consolidate its position as the dominant political force in Madhya Pradesh. A victory for the Congress party would be a major setback for the BJP, and it could also have implications for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</p>

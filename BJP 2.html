            <h1><p class="col1 center"class="large">Is This District Part Of Bengaluru? DK Shivakumar, HD Kumaraswamy Differ</p></h1>
            <div class="col1 center" class="center"><p>Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said the whole of what is now Ramanagara district belongs to Bengaluru.</p>
              
              <p>In what seems be a turf war between him and Janata Dal Secular leader HD Kumaraswamy, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar on Wednesday said the whole of what is now Ramanagara district belongs to Bengaluru and the residents of its four taluks were Bengalurians.</p>
              <p>Mr Shivakumar, who hails from the region and represents Kanakapura Assembly segment in the district, suggested that he has a plan and a blueprint to bring Ramanagara district under Bengaluru, and would reveal it in the days to come.</p>
              <p>Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said he didn't know about the issue as Mr Shivakumar had not discussed with him in this regard hitting back at Mr Shivakumar, Mr Kumaraswamy, a former Chief Minister, who represents Ramanagara Assembly segment in the district, alleged the move could be aimed at regularising "illegal or benami assets".</p>
              <p>He also said Mr Shivakumar should understand that "even after taking seven births one cannot divide Ramangara district." Kumaraswamy was the Chief Minister of the JDS-BJP coalition, when Ramanagara district, which comprises Ramanagara, Channapatna, Magadi and Kanakapura taluks was created in August 2007. Ramanagara, the headquarters of the district with the same name, is about 48 km from Bengaluru city.</p>
              <p>"The whole of Ramanagara district belongs to Bengaluru. Magadi, Channapatna, Kanakapura and Ramanagara is are Bengaluru. What shape this plan has to be given, I will speak about it in the days to come," Mr Shivakumar said.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters here, he said, "There is not so much urgency to give it a shape, we will give it a shape in the days to come, there is a blueprint for it."</p>
              <p>In a post on X, Mr Kumaraswamy said Ramanagara district was formed after scientifically considering and checking the advantages and disadvantages to the people. Hitting back at Mr Shivakumar, he said, "What is in their head? Is it looting lands worth gold in Kanakapura and handing them over to builders? Or build a fort on benami lands that have already been fenced? If you (Shivakumar) tell us, we will be grateful...."</p>
              <p>Mr Shivakumar said: "I'm not bothered about what Mr Kumaraswamy says, what I do or the government does is important. Let Mr Kumaraswamy or anyone else take credit for making Ramanagara a district. The whole of Ramanagara district with its four taluks belongs to Bengaluru, let Mr Kumaraswamy get the documents and have a look at it," he said.</p>

              <h3><p font="Arial" class="large" class="center"width="200%">10 Reasons why Mobile Phones are DANGEROUS to your Health</p></h3>
              <p font="Arial">1. Radio Wave Exposure</p>
              <p>We might start off with the biggest, (and worst sounding) risk. Radio wave exposure is when the radio waves that are sent and    received by mobile phones are absorbed into our bodies.
                
                It might make you think of Hiroshima, but it’s actually reasonably benign according to most studies, which have only found that radio waves cause a very small rise in temperature for the human body.
                
                However, exposure from radiofrequency fields generated by mobile phones can be 1000 times higher than the base station itself. RF fields have been classified as possibly carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
                
               <p> 2. Heat</p>
                <p>Depending on which device you have, heat can often be an issue.
                
                The easiest answer would be to keep your device away from direct sunlight, and to avoid use if it starts to burn like the Fires of Mordor. It’s unlikely to harm you, but you should make sure that your device isn’t faulty if it exceeds the recommended temperature.</p> </div>
              <p font="Arial">3. Risks to Children</p>
                <p>The average adult might be fine, but children are always at more risk to harmful elements in the environment. It’s just another hurdle we all have to go through when growing up, and we’ll feel it once again once we get to old age.
                
                In this case, it’s true that children are more at risk to almost everything, but there has been no proven link between mobile phone use and childhood cancers. It’s still recommended that children limit the amount of time they spend using mobile phones, but it’s understandable that it can be hard to take away devices when it has become a key part of their learning and entertainment.</p>
                
                <p>4. Traffic Accidents</p>
                <p>Governments across the world have moved to curb people using their devices while driving, and the reason why is obvious when you check the stats. A study by the CDC discovered that 69% of US drivers they polled aged 18-64 had made a phone call while driving over the last 30 days. You could be in the minority if you don’t make a cheeky call here and there. The figure fell to 31% for sending or reading text messages or emails, but it’s still dangerously high.
                
                
                Even anecdotally, it’s terrible to see your driver on the phone, and the subtle, tiny swerves that tend to go with their loss of concentration. If the government can’t get through to you, it’s unlikely that I can, but it’s worth reiterating; concentrating on the road should be your number one priority.</p>
              <p>5. Interference with Electrical Equipment</p>
                <p> We’re often told to switch off our phones when we go to the hospital or get on a plane, but why do they even bother, and is it really that important? People seem to be happy blatantly checking their devices while in the waiting room, but it can interfere with certain types of equipment.There’s nothing worse than being a jerk, so if you want to use your phone it’s probably best to head outside, or wait for a better opportunity.</p>
                
                <p>6. Infertility</p>
                <p>Mobile phone use has long been linked with infertility, and it’s worrying for any potential parent. Luckily, the links are often attributed to radiation, so it’s likely that you’ll be fine if you’re careful.
                
                However, one study has shown that the radio waves emitted from cell phones can damage sperm, while the effects for women are still unclear. If you’ve been diagnosed with a low sperm count, be aware that it was only dangerous for sperm while in talk mode. If you often use hands free, consider keeping your device in your back pocket. No, seriously.</p>
                
                <p>7. Sleep Patterns</p>
                <p>If you’ve noticed a difference in your sleep pattern, it’s possible that your device could be the cause. The screen is bright enough to alert your brain, (which keeps you awake for longer) and it can be hard to get to sleep afterwards.
                
                Of course, the only way it can really mess up your pattern is by you looking at it before you lie down, so try to avoid checking your phone if you’re planning on getting ready for bed. Researchers suggested having a screen-free hour before settling down to sleep.</p>
                
                <p>8. Germs</p>
                <p>Germs on your device are way more common than you might expect, and it can be pretty disgusting if you think about it. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that one in six cell phones checked was contaminated by some form of fecal matter, thanks to improper hygiene. It’s a troubling thought considering we keep devices so close to our faces, and it’s enough to make you want to stop using other people’s phones.
                
                If you haven’t already, make sure to give your phone a light scrub when you get the chance. It’s better to be safe than sorry, and the idea of someone else’s germs touching your face should be enough to get you to pay your own phone bills.</p>
                
                <p>9. Eye Health</p>
                <p>Staring at any screen for a prolonged period of time is always inadvisable, but it can often be addictive if you’re used to using your device at length. It’s a problem that is wholly preventable, but sometimes it can be hard to see the damage taking place until it’s too late.
                
                Small text and bright screens combined will cause damage, and considering that over a third of US adults said they spend 4-6 hours per day on a handheld device, maybe it could be time to give smaller screens a break.</p>
                
                <p>10. Brain Damage</p>
                <p>Human Brain
                Brain damage is incredibly worrying, and the link between it and mobile phones seems to derive from radiation emissions. It was originally thought that the radiation from mobile phones could cause tumours, or trigger harmful changes in human cells, but so far there doesn’t seem to be any conclusive evidence to prove that it is actually harmful. It’s seems like it’s more of an urban myth, but it’s still scary.</p>
